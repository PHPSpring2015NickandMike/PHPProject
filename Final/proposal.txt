Michael Hall & Nick Wityak
Advanced PHP Proposal

Team Idea 
We are proposing a simple forum application where Users can register, login, and post questions and answers to various topics on the forum.  
Admins and Users have the following actions
•	Post comments and questions
•	Edit and delete comments
•	Edit and delete questions
•	Edit Account info

Development
We will be using PHP, HTML and CSS with a MySQL database

Tasks
•	Develop a proper database to support the user actions
•	Create a simple login
•	Create an effective and simple front end design which supports the user’s needs
•	Effectively configure user roles to support individual updates and deletes.  

Assigned Tasks
•	Mike will be responsible for creating the database design and functionality (1 week)
•	Nick will be responsible for developing the UI for the forum (1 week)
•	We will both work together as a team to develop the crud operations for each user (2-3 weeks)
We estimate that we will complete the assignment in 4 to 5 weeks
